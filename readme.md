*  ##### These class are:
        cursor1
        cursor2
        cursor3
        cursor4
        cursor5
        
        to...
        
        cursor11
 
 * Example code: 
 ```
 <div class = "create_cursor cursor6> </div>
 ```
 That's it. Now your cursor is changed to a different cursor. Now you changed your website cursor by just defining some class name in a div. 
 Happy Coding!
